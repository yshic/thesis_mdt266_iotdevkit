/// @brief Wrapper class which allows to start a timer and if it is not stopped in the given time then the callback that was passed will be called,
/// which informs the user of the failure to stop the timer in time, meaning a timeout has occured.
/// The class wraps around either the Arduino Ticker class from Arduino (https://github.com/sstaub/Ticker) or the offical ESP Timer implementation from Espressif (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/2bc1f2f574/examples/system/esp_timer), the latter takes precendence if it exists.
/// This is done because the usage is more efficient, under the hood we simply start and then stop and if needed start a oneshot timer again.
/// When using the esp timer directly the same timer can be reused to stop and start and therefore does not need to create a new timer everytime,
/// the Ticker in comparsion automatically deletes a timer once it has been stopped and we therefore need to create it again once the timer is started.
/// This causes a lot of overhead therefore if the esp timer exists we do not use the Ticker class but instead the esp timer directly.
/// For all other use cases where the esp timer does not exists we instead use the Ticker as a fallback, because in that case its implementation is completly different anyway.
/// The class instance is meant to be started with once() which will then call the registered callback after the timeout has passed,
/// if the detach() method has not been called yet.
/// This results in behaviour similair to a esp task watchdog but without as high of an accuracy and without restarting the device,
/// allowing to let it fail and handle the error case silently by the user in the callback method.
/// Documentation about the specific use and caviates of the ESP Timer implementation can be found here https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/esp_timer.html
