/**
 * @brief Manages soil sensor measurements via RS485 Modbus, providing access to pH, moisture, temperature,
 * conductivity, and nutrient levels.
 *
 * The `EsSoil7n1` class facilitates interaction with a 7-in-1 soil sensor over an RS485 Modbus interface.
 * It supports reading soil parameters including pH, moisture, temperature, conductivity, nitrogen,
 * phosphorus, and potassium. The class uses Modbus commands to retrieve data and stores converted values for
 * easy access.
 *
 * ### Features:
 *
 * - Reads soil pH, moisture, temperature, conductivity, and NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels.
 *
 * - Supports combined readings for efficiency (e.g., temperature and moisture, NPK).
 *
 * - Stores sensor values in an internal array for retrieval via getter methods.
 *
 * - Provides debug output for raw Modbus responses when enabled.
 *
 * ### Usage:
 *
 * Instantiate the class and initialize the RS485 serial interface. Call the appropriate `read` methods (e.g.,
 * `readSoilPh()`, `readSoilNPK()`) to retrieve sensor data, then use getter methods (e.g., `getSoilPh()`) to
 * access the converted values. Ensure the sensor is powered and connected properly before reading.
 *
 * ### Dependencies:
 *
 * - Requires an RS485 serial interface (`rs485Serial1`) with Modbus command support.
 *
 * - Sensor must be connected to a valid RS485 bus.
 *
 * - Optional debug output requires a Serial interface when `DEBUG_PRINT` or
 * `DEBUG_PRINT_ES_SOIL_RAW_RESPONSE` is defined.
